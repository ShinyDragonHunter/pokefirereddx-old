# Pokémon FireRed & LeafGreen DX

An enhanced port of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen using Pokémon Emerald's engine as the base.

It builds the following ROM:

* [**pokeemerald.gba**] `sha1: f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).


## What to expect
Do you really think I'm THAT lazy to make this a direct port? New content will be added in to help keep things fresh!

Features:
* Animated Pokémon (With Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen styled animations)
* Compatiblility with official games (Because why not?)
* Battle Frontier (Untouched to maintain compatiblility with official games)
* Mythical events will be available (Including Mew)
* Generation 5+ Repels (Because it's annoying to have to go into your bag each time a repel wears off)
* Nature stat colours (So you know which stat is being raised or lowered accordingly by nature)
* Real-Time Clock and Berry Growth (Both untouched from Pokémon Emerald)
* Johto evolutions to Kanto Pokémon added to Kanto Pokédex (Baby Pokémon are a possibility)

And many more!

Ideas:
* EV Training area available after the main story (Will be useful for team building for the Battle Frontier)
* Backstory for Mr. Fuji and the birth of Mewtwo (To tie in with Mew being available)
